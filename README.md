# algernon
Algernon is our first attempt at software development by clinicians for clinicians.
The objective of the program is to create wrappers and tools that can be used in addition, or in place of, existing EMR systems.
The focus of the effort is on automation, visualization, and analytics.
The core philosophy of the project is that behavioral health care has been slow to adopt new technology, which has had a significant detrimental effect on the quality of care we can provide to the mentally ill.
